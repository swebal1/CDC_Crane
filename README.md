# CDC Crane Survey Analysis
The Crane survey was a PEPFAR-funded study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in conjunction with Makrere University School of Public Health (Kampala, Uganda) and CDC Uganda. It collected biobehavioral information from communities across several districts in Uganda who are at disproportionately high risk of acquiring HIV, including transgender women (TGW), people who inject drugs (PWID), etc. Surveys were conducted using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method, and data collected included prevalence of HIV and HIV testing, experiences with discrimination and stigma, reproductive health metrics, alcohol and drug usage, and much more. 

This repo contains code for analyses of TGW in various districts of Kampala, along with a pooled analysis of TGW across 10 districts. These analyses were used to develop summary documents, highlighting pertinent biobehavioral characteristics across key populations to support ongoing HIV research and prevention efforts in Uganda. All analyses were conducted in R, and visualizations were created in Microsoft Excel.
